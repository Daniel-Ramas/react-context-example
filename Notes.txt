Use Consumers component when you want to get several context objects
example of several context objects

Remember that the consumer will "Consume" the context object that is being passed to the child components

Context for sharing information

Need to fix this application in the future

We wrap LanguageSelector component and User Create Component with Language store so they have the ability to change data in the store

Not actually UserCreate (Components nested within userCreate)

Why to use Redux instead of Context
Redux:
excellent documentation
well known design patterns
tremendous amount of open source libs

Context:
no need for extra libs
unfortunately will need to build a different store for each resource
